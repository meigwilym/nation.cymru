Main site went live. 

Setup SSL with certbot-auto. Everything in /root

# Theme changes

Main changes to home made through the theme options page

I've copied over any files that I've change to this child theme. main changes are removing the author from the page. 

I've deleted the code instead of using the theme options. Call me old fashioned!

Installed jet pack and added a contact page.
